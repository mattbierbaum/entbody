Simple nbody code to simulate a 2D set of particles
using a cell neighbor locator as implemented in OpenKIM.
Has OpenGL display capabilities and is reasonably fast.

CUDA version is found in the cuda folder.

Options in the Makefile so that it works easily
with other systems (edit as necessary):
    DOPLOT - display with opengl
    FPS    - calculate frames per second (not portable)
    POINTS - make the opengl display points, not fancy circles
    OPENMP - use threading through openmp

How to build:
    * if you would like to use plotting, install freeglut, opengl
        sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev

    * need ENTBODY env variable set to the root directory
        export ENTBODY=`pwd`

    * make and run the examples (base program doesn't compile) 
        cd examples; make
