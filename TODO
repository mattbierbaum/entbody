Files to fill in currently:
    sound.c, image.c

Examples to create:
    dislocations, zombies

Examples to improve:
    sand, brazilnuts,

Other ideas:
    * be able to switch out the neighborlocator - we probably don't want to use ifdefs for this
    * be able to use OpenCL as well... this is going to be harder
    * make the CUDA NBL actually work
    *   

Some notes:
    Things that have to always be defined (i.e. they can be filled in for
    any file at compile time) and are literals:
        DIM = number of dimensions
        
    Things that can be included in any library definition:
        N   : number of particles
        L   : side length of box (deprecated soon into cell matrix)
        pbc : periodicity on each edge
        R   : cutoff length
        t   : current time
        dt  : current time step
        x   : position array were y_i = x[DIM*i+1]
        v   : velocity array
        rad : radius of particles
        col : color factor (this will be deprecated soon hopefully)
        type: type of particle
