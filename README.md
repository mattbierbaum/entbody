Introduction
------------
Simple nbody code to simulate a 2D set of particles.
Has OpenGL display capabilities and is reasonably fast.

I've decided to keep all variations of the code in one 
convenient place as I discover how to incorporate new features.
The main place where these end up is eventually entbody.all.

Variations
----------
The current variations are:
* entbody.all - an attempt to include all listed below in one format
* entbody.micro - a single file implementation (2 with plotting).  short range forces only.

To learn about any of these variations, please read their corresponding README.md
